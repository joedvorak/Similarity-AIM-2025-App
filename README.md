# Presentation Similarity Exploration Web App
This web app is based on Streamlit. It creates a simple web page for exploring the similarities between presentations. It has been designed to help visualize presentation similarities for the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual Internation Meeting.

It currently contains data from AIM 2024.

You can also visualize the impact of moving presentations to different sessions on the overal session similarity score.
